# Facial Recognition System for School Attendance 📚🧑‍🏫

This project aims to develop a facial recognition system to automate the student attendance process in schools using the OpenCV library. 🤖

## Features:
- **Face Detection**: Using Haar Cascade to detect faces in images. 👀
- **Facial Recognition**: Implementation of the LBPH algorithm to identify students. 🧑‍💻
- **Web Interface**: Simple interface for uploading photos and registering attendance. 🌐
- **Storage**: In development. The system currently does not have data storage functionality. 💾

## Technologies:
- **OpenCV**: Library for face detection and recognition. 📸
- **Python**: Main programming language for the project. 🐍
- **Flask**: Framework for creating the web interface. 🖥️

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rianymello/PAP.git
