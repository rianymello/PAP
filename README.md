# **Facial Recognition System for School Attendance** 📚🧑‍🏫

This project aims to develop a **facial recognition system** to automate the student attendance process in schools using the **OpenCV** library. 🤖

## **Features**:
- **Face Detection**: Using **Haar Cascade** to detect faces in images. 👀
- **Facial Recognition**: Implementation of the **LBPH algorithm** to identify students. 🧑‍💻
- **Web Interface**: Simple interface for uploading photos and registering attendance. 🌐
- **Storage**: In development. The system currently does not have data storage functionality. 💾

## **Technologies**:
- **OpenCV**: Library for face detection and recognition. 📸
- **Python**: Main programming language for the project. 🐍
- **Flask**: Framework for creating the web interface. 🖥️

## **Dependencies**:
To run the project, you need to install the following Python dependencies:
- **OpenCV**: For face detection and recognition.
- **Flask**: Web framework for the interface.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations in image processing.
- **Pillow**: Image processing library used for image enhancement.
